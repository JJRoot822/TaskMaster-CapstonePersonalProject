    <h3>Application&apos;s purpose</h3>
    <p>
        This application is intended to be used to help independent developers effectively manage development projects and various details surrounding them including tasks to complete, bugs to fix, issues to resolve and more. You will also be able to search through projects and their associated items.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>App Platforms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>macOS 14</li>
        <li>iOS 17</li>
        <li>iPadOS 17</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>Technologies to be Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Swift Programming Language</li>
        <li>SwiftUI (Apple’s latest user interface framework)</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Core Web API using .NET 7 for the backend</li>
        <li>Entity Framework Core and SQLite for the database connectivity (Was originally going to be MySQL, but complications arose, so to avoid further issues, I chose to go with SQLite, but in future for release when I’m graduated it can easily use SQL Server in Azure or some other cloud service)</li>
        <li>Username, email and password authentication, which will be handled by the web service</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Changes Since Sprint 1</h3>

    <p>
        The primary changes that have taken place since the end of the previous sprint is that the API written in C# has been completed and tested and now works. I can now begin working on the iOS/iPadOS/macOS app written in Swift and SwiftUI. I have also cut down the number of features the app will have to ensure that I have enough time to actually finish the project at a satisfactory degree and as a result of undoing some of the overthinking and overcomplicating things I had done in the initial planning stage. If I had to do something differently, it would be having a more clear head and coherent plan from the beginning instead of this grand vision for the app I had initially.
